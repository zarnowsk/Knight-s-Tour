Welcome to Knight's Tou by Michal Zarnowski




<><> -- BACKGROUND INFORMATION -- <><>

A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard
such that the knight visits every square exactly once. If the knight
ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square 
(so that it could tour the board againimmediately, following the same 
path), the tour is closed; otherwise, it is open.


<><> -- HOW TO PLAY -- <><>
In order to start the game, launch the 'KnightsTour.exe' file located 
inside the same directory as this file.*
1) Select game approach. Non-intelligent will choose Knight's move at random,
   intelligent will choose next move based on accessibilty heuristic (higher 
   chance of success).
2) Select how many times you'd like the Knight to attempt the tour.
3) Select the starting board position for the Knight by selecting row and column.
4) Hit Begin tour!
5) Results of the run will be displayed below showing the order of each move.
   Zeros indicate unreached positions.

inside the '/KnightsTourForm/bin/debug/' folder.
